# ðŸš— Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Dashboard  

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview  
This project presents an **interactive Tableau dashboard** that analyzes the adoption and trends of **Electric Vehicles (EVs)** in the United States. The dashboard highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) and provides insights into consumer preferences, manufacturer dominance, and EV adoption across different states.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose  
The purpose of building this dashboard is to:  
- Track **how EV sales are increasing year by year**  
- Identify **which companies are leading the EV market**  
- Compare **consumer preferences between BEV (Battery Electric Vehicles) and PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles)**  
- Explore the **geographic distribution of EV adoption** across states  

## ðŸ›  Features  
- **KPIs Used:**  
  - Total Vehicles  
  - Average Electric Range (Miles)  
  - Total BEV Vehicles  
  - Total PHEV Vehicles  
- **Visual Insights:**  
  - Year-wise EV adoption trend  
  - Top 5 manufacturers by market share  
  - EV adoption by state (map view)  
  - CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) eligibility analysis  
  - EV model-level comparison (Tesla, Nissan, Chevrolet, etc.)  

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset  
- **Source:** [Kaggle â€“ Electric Vehicle Population Data](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
- Contains details about EV types, manufacturers, models, eligibility, and registration across the U.S.  

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies  
- **Data Visualization:** Tableau  
- **Data Source:** Kaggle Dataset

## âœ… Key Insights  
- Tesla dominates the EV market with the highest share of vehicles  
- BEVs make up the majority of EVs (~77.6%) compared to PHEVs (~22.4%)  
- EV adoption shows a strong growth trend, especially post-2018  
- States like California have the highest number of EV registrations  

## ðŸ”® Future Work  
To make the analysis more comprehensive, the following improvements can be added:  
- **Forecasting EV adoption trends** using time-series analysis  
- **Analyzing charging infrastructure** availability vs. EV adoption  
- **Comparing EV policies across states** to measure their impact on adoption  
- **Consumer preference analysis** for range, brand, and price segment  
- **Integration with real-time EV data** for live dashboard updates
